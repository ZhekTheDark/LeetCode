/**
 * Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The relative order of the elements may be changed.
 * <p>
 * Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the first part of the array nums.
 * More formally, if there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of nums should hold the final result.
 * It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements.
 * <p>
 * Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums.
 * <p>
 * Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
 * <p>
 * Custom Judge:
 * The judge will test your solution with the following code:
 * <p>
 * int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
 * int val = ...; // Value to remove
 * int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length.
 * // It is sorted with no values equaling val.
 * int k = removeElement(nums, val); // Calls your implementation
 * assert k == expectedNums.length;
 * sort(nums, 0, k); // Sort the first k elements of nums
 * for (int i = 0; i < actualLength; i++) {
 * assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
 * }
 * If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
 * Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
 * Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
 * It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
 * <p>
 * Example 2:
 * Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
 * Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]
 * Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4.
 * Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.
 * It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * 0 <= nums.length <= 100
 * 0 <= nums[i] <= 50
 * 0 <= val <= 100
